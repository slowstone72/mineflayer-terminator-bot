# mineflayer-terminator-bot
A Mineflayer bot for Minecraft designed to slay your mortal enemies.
## Requirements
- Node.js
- edit-json-file from npm (could be adapted to work without this)
## Overview
- index.js creates and manages the configuration (config.json)
- index.js launches app.js

Simply fill in your config file and use the chat commands in-game:
- come - sends the bot to you
- kill username - tries to attack and kill the user with the name you said
Will likely need updating.

The bot will try to automatically equip armour and weapons you give to it.
